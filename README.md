### SYNESTIC

#### Summary

SYNESTIC is an experiment in crypto-powered procedurally generated music loops backed by NFTs.
A `SYN` is an audio loop with up to five instrument tracks/layers. Two SYNs can be combined to produce a third, potentially more complex SYN.

### Abstract


Interest and understanding of music is a fundamental part of being human. No other beings, that we know of, share our understanding of it. It's value is tangible and linked to the inner workings of human consciousness, as far as history shows. Humans have clustered around it and musical currents have always been in the sidelines of revolutions and paradigm shifts. What better medium to showcase relative value.

A SYN is a non-fungible token with 74 bytes of metadata, at the time of this writing. The metadata initially based on the inherent entropy in the blockchain, provides the basis of a simple sound loop. Two SYNs can combine and give birth to a new one.

### SYN Lifecycle

Gen0 SYNs are minted automatically every block. You can find some you like, buy them for a small fee and combine them to get something more. You are the curator. 
By creating this economy we will be able to see how genres may emerge, and analyse the tree that gave birth to a loop.

### SYN Remixing

Currently remixing is done in our contract but we intend to abstract that to a separate contract and publish the spec. Then allow anybody to specify a `remixer contract address` when initiating a remix, it will need to only turn two 76 byte arrays into a 3rd.
