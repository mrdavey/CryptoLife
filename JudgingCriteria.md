# #CryptoLife Judging Criteria

> “Do not wait for the last judgment. It comes every day.” - Albert Camus
 
We know that all hackers really want to know is what the rules are before any event occurs (mostly so they can figure out how to break them...) So, here you are good people: the judging criteria we will be using for #CryptoLife in Prague, from the 26-28th October.

## Intellectual Property Rights

All submissions remain the intellectual property of the individuals or organizations that developed them.

All submissions will occur through [this open source repository](https://github.com/status-im/CryptoLife), and code submitted must therefore have an [open source](https://opensource.org/faq) license, some examples of which can be found [here](https://opensource.org/licenses).

## Protection of Intellectual Property

By submitting an Entry or accepting any prize, you represent and warrant the following: 
* you will not submit content that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the content; 
* the content submitted by you does not contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms or other disabling devices or harmful code.

## Copyright

You represent and warrant that you are the sole author and copyright owner of the Submission, and that the Submission is an original work of yours, or if the Submission is a work based on an existing application, that you have acquired sufficient rights to use and to authorize others; and that the Submission does not infringe upon any copyright or upon any other third party rights of which you are aware, and that the Submission is free of malware.

## Eligibility

CryptoLife organizers have the right at their sole discretion to determine whether an entrant is eligible for the Contest. #CryptoLife may disqualify, at the organizers’ sole discretion, entries (including, without limitation, content submitted in connection therewith) that (a) are in violation of third party rights or law or regulation, or (b) displays or uses content that #CryptoLife or Sponsors otherwise finds objectionable.

## Judging Criteria

| Criterion | Weighting Factor | Details |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Creativity     | 3 | Buidling products or services that genuinely require blockchains and that also bring real utility to people's lives requires really creative thinking. This category is weighted extra because it's so important to think outside the box when bringing crypto closer to life.     |
| Technical Innovation| 2 | a.k.a. "Appropriate use of blockcahins and technical difficulty of task". As important as coming up with creative solutions is implementing them in ways which leverage the benefits networks like Ethereum really provide (distributed computation, censorship resistance, provenance, reliability, security, robustness). We want to see innovative thinking in terms of scaling products or services on shared networks, optimisation of smart contract processes, interesting ways of testing, verification or auditability etc. |
| Execution | 1 | We strongly encourage teams to produce a demo when presenting to the judges on the 28th. We understand that some hacks don't get completed, and that's totally OK! Just show us what you got, because running code really counts. |
| Business Model | 1 | We aren't really looking for a traditional model here, but we need to see evidence that you've thought of the viability of your product or service and how it might sustain itself in the long term. Understanding of how your hack fits into the current ecosystem, and the specific problem it solves in relation to the needs we all share earns extra points, as do models with unique and innovative funding mechanisms (i.e. not everything requires a token). |
| Pitch | 1 | Each time will get a set amount of time to pitch their projects to the judges once the hacking itself has ended. The demo itself is marked separately, but the ability to explain your ideas concisely and directly in a short period of time and in such a way that it grabs people attention are equally important skills in building sustainable products and communities. |
User Experience & Design | 1 | We really care about UX and Deisgn at Status. Building a more distributed future requires designing new ways for people to interact, transact and relate directly. While we understand that polishing a product is not a top priority at a hackathon, we would like to see at least some thought given to how people will be able to use your product/service easily. |
"Wow" Factor | 1 | If we're going to bring crypto closer to life, we have to really "wow" people. Some things at hackathons just don't fit neatly into predetermined categories, so we'll leave the final 10 marks open for the general "wow" you leave in the judges' minds. Such future! |

## Categories and Prizes

Each category will be marked out of 10, bringing us to a score out of 100. The top 5 scores in each category will then be discussed independently by the judges, who will announce the winners and runners up in each track after further deliberation. Their decisions will be final.

Each major sponsor also gets to specify a list of hacks they'd like to see, or potentially even their own track. These will also be announced before the event, and will serve as separate prizes also handed out at the closing ceremony.

And that's all she wrote. We can't wait to see you in Prague to bring crypto one more step closer to real life for all of us.
